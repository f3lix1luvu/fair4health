HEALTH DISPARITIES </h1>
<h4>
 HEALTH DISPARITIES or HEALTH INEQUALITY  are the contrast or gaps in the level of health and healthcare between gender, race, income, disabilities, geographic location, and sexual orientation. These are associated with social determinants of health such as racism, stigma, poverty, and unequal access to healthcare. However, to specify, we will mainly focus on health disparities among people who cannot access better healthcare due to their geographic location. 
</h4>


<h4>    According to Fran (2022), The Philippines always has high-quality healthcare. The medical personnel in the Philippines possess exceptional qualifications and skills. While state-funded public healthcare in the Philippines is generally of high quality, there are significant differences between rural and urban areas. In the Philippines, GIDA(Geographically Isolated and disadvantaged areas) have been constantly suffering through health disparities due to lack of healthcare facilities in the area. Additionally, most of our health professionals, especially nurses, either work in larger cities or have left the nation for better income, leading to understaffing and delays in treatment in the country. 
</h4>


<h4>
             Access to high-quality healthcare services continues to be a challenge for people living in remote communities. Residents in rural areas often have to travel far to get to hospitals, especially if they need specialized medical help. This can be hard because it takes a long time, costs a lot of money, transportation may not be reliable, and means they have to take time off work.

<h1> TIPS </h1>

<h3> A. Designing a website to encourage universal health coverage and raise awareness of the significance of healthcare services in rural areas.</h3>

<p>       
       A website allows individuals to contact you and join your efforts when they come across you online through similar topics or an interest in your cause. It stores your contact information, which you may set, update, and manage. Creating a web page where everyone can lend their help and donations to us is a big step towards implementing this plan. 
It encompasses the entire range of vital health services, including health promotion, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, and palliative care.
</p>

<h3> B. Create health facilities in rural areas </h3>

<p>
   Creating health facilities in rural areas can give people access to health care more efficiently. However, there are issues with this plan since compared to urban areas, rural healthcare facilities confront more financial difficulties. There are fewer patients to care for when the population is smaller resulting in the decrease of revenue. 
</p>

<h3>  C. Implement Mobile Health Clinics </h3>

<p> 
        A mobile clinic is a clinic that can visit different locations to offer medical services. They may employ a mix of doctors, nurses, community health workers, and other health professionals to provide a broad range of health services. By accessing communities in isolated or underserved locations, mobile clinics remove geographical obstacles and provide necessary medical treatments to people who might otherwise find it difficult to get healthcare. This enhances access to health care.
</p>

<h3> D. Collaborate with Larger facilities  </h3>

<p>
  Of course, money comes into play here. To address this issue, we can collaborate with larger facilities. Rural healthcare facilities can enhance patient care by providing better, more financially sustainable infrastructure and resources by joining up with larger healthcare systems in more urban areas. Rural communities can benefit from expanded, specialized healthcare services through partnerships with larger healthcare institutions. Although it doesn't change the fact that the income is still lower,  smaller healthcare facilities can cut expenses and reach more remote regions by working together with larger legacy institutions. Furthermore, according to Bosch (2015),  Collaboration in health care has been found to improve patient outcomes by lowering preventable adverse drug responses, morbidity and mortality rates, and optimizing prescription dosages. Teamwork has been found to benefit healthcare practitioners by minimizing additional work and enhancing job satisfaction.
</p>

<h3> E. Fundraising </h3>

<p>
 Fundraising is the practice of obtaining voluntary contributions of money or other resources, carried out by non-profit organizations.  It is often the lifeline for organizations that are working to address critical needs within communities. These donations could assist us in establishing well-equipped healthcare facilities and employ more medical professionals.

<h1> CONCLUSION </h1>

<h4> There are still obstacles that can and might happen and there are still issues that we should consider that might not have been properly addressed here. These are just tips or bits of advice to help address the main issue which is health disparities in rural communities. </h4>
